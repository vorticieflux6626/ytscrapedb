      "ladies and gentlemen thank you for coming back to another edition of tesla vision tv we are going to review some work of a very special individual that has persevered through much of controversy in pursuit of technological advancement for all humankind his work in tesla oriented technologies is very interesting and has been gaining some monumental support in popular culture we have here with us today mr. eric dollar and also my co-host zoran pilot who has also been traveling around the world recently and has been meeting with various organizations at the tesla museum of belgrade and educating individuals of much of the great work that is being conducted here and around the world on tesla related technologies well thank you sam i'm glad to be back and i'm glad that you have this guest because as you know i live in california and i'm very much fearless person but to be honest with you they stick to work very hard on me knowing those two earthquakes that i survived here and it's a northridge and whittier and i really appreciate and i gonna be very very good listener what eric has to say eric welcome to the show thank you welcome please eric if you will tell us a bit about your recent campaign that has been a very successful well i mean i'm kind of at a distant end of it so i'm just learning about a lot of this stuff now so after being out in the desert and it's fantastic that that all this has happened because we really faced a big obstacle of having to come up with the bond to build on government property and i didn't know if we were going to make that through that and and it's absolutely fantastic that that's happened now that things can really start to advance wonderful wonderful now ladies and gentlemen for listeners mr. dollard has begun a project to make an advanced seismic warning system and it's apparently built on tesla technology would you please enlighten our audience a bit on how you feel that this seismic warning system is predicated to tesla technology well actually it's an advancement on tech tesla technology made by ernst alexander 'some and then i made an advancement upon that in order to make it a wideband system where you weren't confined to one resident frequency but it would work over the entire audio frequency band up into the the higher end of the vlf part that only like coyotes and and rats can hear up about 250 kilocycles and that basically is my own invention took about 30 years to figure it out from an analytical standpoint then about 10 years the antenna wasn't that hard to build other than finding the parts but it took 10 years to develop the special receiver to go with it at landers california and then upon its completion it was promptly taken away from me so now i'm trying to start over again but it's not at this day and age i can't just go back to rca or bell telephone and get the parts i need because those organizations don't exist anymore and the parts all appear on the internet if you can even find them for massive quantities of money right now we need a power supply for a project we're working on and and just because the stuffs made by the phone company somebody wants almost $1000 for it i can imagine yeah so what other technological or financial hurdles would you say you're currently undergoing to continue with your project i mean you're well funded with pursuing all the materials and you're i understand you have a brilliant idea of utilizing old telephone poles as it were to essentially cut down on the material cost and you're essentially having a really great project for that could possibly be replicated elsewhere in the country for utilizing old modes of electrical transfer yeah it's um basically what i'm building now it's not on the san andreas fault where we're you know previously it was so it's more of a demonstrator model one thing that made this possible is when the government took over certain track to land there there was a about maybe a mile and a half of utility poles carrying a cable television coaxial cable is 45 poles in the right away and you know i'm not really enthused anymore about digging 45 telephone pole holes if you know what i mean plus finding the poles and the rest of that so one major portion of the labor is done there and then the same organization on kind of the other side of that track to land out there in the desert has on the death valley side has about maybe i would say eight or ten miles of pretty damaged but a lot of useful parts of the jay carrier telephone lines that we need to make the alexander sand in ten out of so so once the wind stopped and it starts to warm up we we're going to take down about two miles it's going to be a lot of work and then and then pack that up and then start to put that up for the alexandros an antenna system but before we put the alexander antenna system up we have to clean up the coaxial lines that are draping all over the place and remove some of them those busted poles we have to replace so so basically because of the weather conditions and you only can work like april may june and then it becomes like november december about expecting about within one year we will have the alexanderson antenna up on the poles okay also and then in the meantime i have to find the terminal equipment which is going to be a lot of obsolete bell telephone wireline carrier stuff fortunately i just came across some very valuable items and trade for some work i did on a system that somebody else has and and then the money that's left over from the indiegogo thing there's fifteen thousand dollars after the government bond i have to start going on ebay now and finding the the pen recorders for the mechanical seismograph end of it and the electrical indications the university of that area has donate a complete seismograph pickup installation to us which is a massive step forward so so fortunately in this place a map which i'm kind of keeping a secret there's the government support level is high and that's going to save me a lot of effort having to make my own stuff or go out and find this stuff it's it's actually everyone's really excited how there's some kind of karma that's just pushing this whole project forward erik obviously you know indiegogo campaign was successful you have a good followers your idea is very much noble when you talk about the government support why they wouldn't support even more i mean we always whenever the earthquake is we witness you know they're saying and claiming the prediction cannot be done and we very well know that animals have that instinct that they have that sense of listening those frequencies you know that's actually pretty much what you're trying to do why they are not getting more involved you know and what secrets pretty much they would love from you to be revealed and what you kind of hiding in the sense you know that that is protected as your intellectual property yeah i mean it's you're dealing with a complicated situation you know not all not all government agencies are friendly with other government agencies and there's there's certain government agencies that despise earthquake prediction because that's where they derive their funding so they're not your friend in these type of situations but then there's other things going on communications wise here and scientifically the the seismic aspect of it is only one part of what's going on here the alexander's the network is is that i'm building is a highly generalized system that will allow for studies of propagation and and and many communications and many other things so so that is kind of why the project is getting supported it's not being government lis supported by people that are interested in the earthquake stuff those people would try to shut the project down so i'm really in a very delicate situation talking about stuff on the air absolutely understandable i mean you've been the scientist and you've been acclaimed you know a writer can you take us a little bit back you know basically of your interest you know how did you got into the you know all this electricity and how do you associate yourself with tesla work well my interest of electricity goes back to very very early childhood when the things that would happen with power lines when i was about five or six years old were so stunning when something would go wrong that you know it made an impact on me as what was going on there and how these things came about so about the age of seven back in the 50s you know you could do stuff you can't do these things this day and age but i was allowed to hang out with the line crews and then they taught me the principles and then about the time i was in the fifth grade the local power company started providing me with a lot of special education material from from the the corporate office there so at that time i mean i was basically capable of constructing any outside plant you know transformer banks of you know delta-y configurations on them sectional icing switches dead dead end poles i knew all that stuff in the fifth grade then rca got involved my junior high school year first year in high school and then they gave me free front free run of was one of the biggest radio transmitting facilities on the planet and there was a lot of you know insurance paperwork and complications that i have to to figure out a way through to get you know so that i can hang out you know around 12,000 volt systems and all that as a juvenile and that was all taken care of by the school and my parents and rca that was a major step forward because then at that point the original prints for the alexanderson system and the people that worked on it there the polina station was a singular alexander s'en system that no one knows about none of the ones that are portrayed today in any way resemble it and that was all made available to me along with any that i wanted to do there in the station to be part of its operation like tuning up transmitters or fixing equipment so with that and then in my senior year i don't know exactly how this came about there's a number of possibilities one is about my senior year in high school i had all the necessary fcc licenses to be any kind of radio or radar engineer so the phone company showed up looked like a couple fbi spooks they came into my geometry class and pulled me and my closest friend out of class they said we want you to come out somebody want to talk to you you know my first response was sheer terror because you know i figured you know the thing that wiped out all the tv reception last night in town that i was experimenting what got me in big trouble and and they wanted me to come once a week to one of their bell telephone facilities and they had some plan for me so they brought me there and they gave me free run of the facilities not to the extent of rca and that there always had to be somebody with me and i was more directed but they gave me lots of books and then they wanted me when i got on high school to go to work in the telephone companies so by the time i graduated from high school i was already electrical engineer and how did you discover that curiosity you know pretty much we always talk about that creativity and your vision your interest it was kind of hidden you and you know you discover your godly icon in you and you start pursuing that you know i mean it looks like it's your life so what do you see you know of your prior achievement and what do you hope to achieve well i mean that's kind of a big jump from high school i don't know i mean to describe the way that i think and operate i don't i don't know if it's possible or people will understand it because you have to remember that i'm a feral human and you know and to be brought into the standard environment the people that live in is hideous to me it's the first thing i want to do is run six days to get over it and it really overwhelms me and it gives me bad dreams and all that type of stuff so i work on a level more like you know i would say like a coyote so whatever a coyote objectives are that's kind of what my objectives are i don't know how to convert it into human terms so see ya the thing is is i want to do this but i can't do this and then i do this and then it's destroyed and then you know i'm living in a retrograde society that's equivalent to you know a fully loaded railroad train going over the tehachapi to 80 miles an hour and you climb up to the front to find out where it's going so fast and there's nobody in the controls there yeah so i don't know what to say about any of it so now i've been directed by whatever force is and voodoo and whatever to this particular project so i'm going to make another round for the alexander's in that one oh what what i want to point out okay is when when i had graduated from my relationship with rca and bell telephone rca actually continue for much longer after high school and went into the navy and then actually got to be have problems thrown on me that nobody in the navy could figure out and i wasn't you know i didn't know everything back then either and they start to apply this stuff and then built they'll help me build up my own personal power so that you know i really after i got out of the navy and had all these incredible experiences and responsibilities it wasn't really possible for me to go back into normal life so rca had a plan for me kind of i don't know how i would say but none of us at the time me or in the district vice-president or the technicians i worked with really had an idea where the situation would go but the complication that was existent that was a problem for all of us is that hf and medium frequency radio was being superseded by the satellites and rca needed to come up with some kind of advancement beyond that that would keep those technologies operational so at that point everything was turned over to me the corporation died a couple of years so my position in the company never transpired and and then diane feinstein converted san francisco at that time and so all my equipment was smashed and the whole neighborhood was bulldozed so i became a street person i lived out of garbage cans for years so in that process then i can no longer use equipment so it was time to learn mathematics so and i lived in the bushes outside of somebody's house that turned out to be follow forints werth the third of the son of the inventor of television and that created a big shift right there because then family secrets had never been revealed to the public or revealed to me how this guy made radio tubes have powered themselves and actually helped the things in my hand it was a joke actually by five-o he didn't think i could figure him out and and on top of that i was related with rca which was an enemy of the farnsworth family so but when i explained to him how the tube work that i'd never seen before he was thrown back at his chair and the family adopted me and so that kind of helped me learn new things and keep going and then because it was only math there was no more parts he gave me a couple of very important math books then i discovered that a lot of the stuff that was taught to me by rca historically and technically left out some very important details and that all landed right on top of nikola tesla so i got a the best biography for nikola tesla the one by jj o'neil prodigal genius and i started reading through that and i couldn't stop i read the whole thing from front to back until the library closed it left me so nearsighted i could far literally find my way out of the library from all reading the whole book and that transformed me forever because then i realized that i didn't know everything about electricity and nobody knew everything about electricity and really nobody knew anything about electricity and there was new things to be discovered and then later on all the notes and diagrams that i drew on benches you know and in coffee shops and all that living on the street starting to get out in public this borderlands sciences thing latched onto it and then i developed some kind of popularity through that and then i started to get funded to do things and then the things i got funded to do got destroyed and then i got funded to other things and then those things got destroyed and it just kept going on until recently everything was destroyed my car was vandalized my coyote was taken away from my installation was i don't i still don't know what's going on there i need somebody investigate it so it all took the big squat and i was left completely destitute in the desert yeah with nowhere to go and sabotage car and no money and and you know so i had to get on the the welfare which normally you can't do but i was able to do there and then i started hanging out with some people in the museum that read a lot and wanted to know about this stuff and so we started having these little thursday morning get-togethers and then that got me inspired to start writing stuff and that started this whole series on energetic form that led to and we're we're sitting right now so that's kind of the life story very doll work with lots of giant holes and can you tell us a little bit about your new book on polyphase mathematics i believe it is posted on the energetic form well it's starting to get posted on the energetic form but it's a massive project because there's there's over 2,000 equations in this book so what what came about is is is a popular lecture was requested of me to be presented oh i think like last june that's july and this was like several months in advance and i didn't know if i wanted to do it you know i was in a situation where people were screwing me up again it was kind of another quasi kidnapping thing i got tricked into something that you know these people are going to support me and then they know now they're defaming me on the internet and all that and in the middle of that crisis i was requested to produce some lecture at that point i really have no tristan in much writing anything anymore but but i decided to go about it and then so i didn't know how to to start this thing and then so publicly was requested of me as people wanted to know about my four quadrant theory of electricity so i tried to figure how it's going to start this and then then once i picked up the trail it almost became a daily obsession i spent 8 hours a day on it for about four or five months and after i gave the talk it kept going and it turned into this book the four quadrant representation of electricity and then in the process of trying to explain things in terms that anybody could understand i've learned all kinds of fascinating things and then there's another project i'm working on with relations a particular type of interference it's being generated by the power company and a number of papers have requested me to that and i go okay well it's time for me to go back to something that i got i learned in high school and i wrote papers on a long time ago about imaginary number is this let's let's take this thing the whole way and and it just kept going and i may make more discoveries and and until now basically i've written a book on the complex verse or algebra and imaginary numbers and and alternating current that has never been done before wow that is phenomenal erica start it started off steinmetz was pretty much the end of the classical mathematics for electricity but the tesla polyface has some really defies conventional mathematical analysis that's the problem and a westinghouse engineer by the name of dr. fortescue came up with the system of mathematics that as far as the science of algebra goes should have been an international hit but because it was an engineer and an american engineer it was ignored except by the american engineering people the industry and what have you and they found through this guy's mathematics you can finally define polyphase power systems but the mathematics that he wrote was so confusing and generalized and people wrote books on it and they didn't understand what was happening and i'm stuck in a situation where where i have to make a engineering reports and present them to the government they can't be wishy-washy so i have to go back and revamp the whole thing in the end and take it to a level that no one had ever taken it before and it ready i just got me all excited and i'm not done with it yet but but the theoretical end is done and it'll all be because it's like trying to squeeze an elephant through a quarter inch hole it'll come out on the internet over some period of time pretty much who do you have as a supporter i mean there is a lot of work that you put on yourself and obviously it takes you know a lot of effort resources and something like that do you have assistants followers you know that they're working close to you i have one person who's in his late 20s and he likes to climb telephone poles and dig holes and do all that kind of stuff and build things and and be part of all this so between the two of us and our toyota vehicles we go out there into the wilderness and and tackle this whole thing and that's really all pretty much all we need it's just a matter if you know somebody paying for the gas and and all that okay you already had some kind of results you know in measurements that kind of showed your work and direction in which you're going you know is that something you know that can convince certain investors you know to push your work you know to limit that you can do a little bit maybe faster or more comfortable well i don't know you know ultimately most of the people that are donated to this don't fully understand you know all the math and engineering of it that couldn't be expected the people that do you know or most of these physicists and all that stuff and they have this einstein religion that you know they freaked out so those people will not support you they'll figure out a way to screw you up so i don't know you know the thing is i'm stuck in a certain way right now where i was told i was going to be provided with the building and only to be taken away from me in several months it was a lie and i don't know how to get out of that if i lose my building it's going to make it tough we're going to have to do all this stuff out with automobiles but just fine i've done that before but it's going to make it difficult plus all the accumulated material is going to get lost so it's another ransom situation and it will probably you know the ransom demand will be between seventy and a hundred thousand dollars in order to keep my building and this is going to be you know an issue that's going to be coming up here in about four or five months but right now you know from the government and i've been advised to ignore that pay no attention to it and just blaze forward on this project and worry about what's going to happen later so that's basically what we're doing but at some point i have got this sort of damocles hanging over my head that's got all of a sudden completely disrupt the whole deal and then all in all because you know i've got you know what the person i talked to helping me and then it's another guy about the same age that you know now it's gone forward and out of his own pocket you know has is putting together the so-called tesla magnifying transmitter in the cosmic induction generator and you know and he needs some kind of financial backup i mean so basically just to break ground we're looking at the director of the organization says two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to make a real laboratory for eric dollar that just has the basic stuff of the you know fighting with the power company and trying to get the right power anymore it's nearly impossible that's that's one of the things that instigated the writing of this this ac mathematics paper because i have to prove that the whole electrical grid of the united states is going in the retrograde and it's either going to turn into an emp generator or an emp receiver and everything is going to take a squat so for people that are watching this you know beside you know financial power is anything else you know that you need and somebody that could watch this you know can get back to you and touch and kind of support your work and help you what you're doing is anybody that buys my papers or books or videos or any of that that goes in - basically paying the utilities and the operating expenses to keep this building going and that you know it's like a tick in my neck the size of a football the way i live i'm used to you know i live on my souls and security in my toyota corolla and the bushes the expenses are very low and all of a sudden i got robbed roped into this situation that i can't afford so it's fortunate that that people are buying the material and the videos that i've made because otherwise the lights are gonna get turned off as i said you know me being you know the person who is a really uncomfortable you know with that rattling living in california and fearing you know that big one that's supposed to come i think you know absolutely were needed you know this type of discovery to be resolved because obviously it should be some kind of weight predicting these disasters that happen the northridge earthquake that was i believe i wasn't at the station at the time but the people were there said there was an 18-hour notice on that one the landers earthquake oddly enough the beginnings of the station there in landers that i built and of course it was on the epicenter didn't need a lot of fancy equipment then and that was another 18 the 24 hour warning from what i understand from the people there plus i picked that one up at my station in bolinas and on a long-distance path through the honest fear which at landers is the same thing i picked up from japan 48 hours before that earthquake occurred so it's it's pretty definite now that these electrostatic waves and earthquakes are tied together and i know the details of it the station at landers was not an experimental station it was an engineered station designed to serve the southern california area another station needed to go up and it was mainly for the southern california gas company and la department of water and power it's not something you advertise and you don't get on the internet like chicken little and scream you know that the ground is going to bust open day after tomorrow that'd be a stupid thing to do if you make more of a disaster than the earthquake but that station is destroyed and because one and a half million dollars to put something like that up again in southern california and statistically the next big earthquake statistics are dangerous the full-width as far as prediction but statistically the next big california earthquake will be in southern california it will not be in northern california and it will happen within the next four or five years and in general earthquakes since the indonesia one have become 10 decibels stronger so what used to be a seven is going to be an eight and what used to be an eight is going to be a nine and you know and you know the us geological survey is not making anything that works and it's going to make sure that anything that does work doesn't work and it's 1.5 million dollars and i'm 62 years old and i don't have 30 years to make another one anymore so these are all the parameters of the situation let me ask you something i mean the same situation was with tesla you know that the amount of ideas and discoveries you know his body couldn't carry that long where we can meet you where we can talk to you face to face how do you pretty much engage with the people who wants to know more and you know basically to get in touch with you well after the tech saavy episode there won't be any more face to face it's the basic thing to do is i have a general delivery address because in the eastern sierras there's a lot of people that live way up in those mountains and they come down every one or two months for their mail it's amazing you know there's people that walk hundreds and hundreds of miles up in those mountains and then they come down to these towns so so being that i'm one of those kind of creatures i have a post-office receptacle in lone pine california and the best thing to do is to write me yeah that's about this what's about this energy science technology conference okay now that's going to where i'm going to switch over the ac thing i'd like to keep working on that but but at any rate i have to come up with a new topic and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to get into the theoretical and practical details of this whole test law and alexander s'en and all of this type of radio that does not involve electromagnetic waves and does not involve the speed of light and of course the telluric system you know for advanced seismic warning or submarine communications or talking to ships or whatever it might be is all based on this so that process the seed just sprouted on it about a month ago and it's hard in the beginning to say exactly how it's going to go because it's going to be you know it's going to pretty soon here it's going to light off to eight hours a day of writing so it's a complicated subject it's not going to be like the last one you know where it's all historical and you know and you see pictures of ancient greeks like plato you know is it just a beautiful you know coastal towns in greece it's going to be more you know complicated relationships and and a lot of it is going to be explanations of what i have already written in what i call the rca book which is is out under the title wireless giant at the pacific because in my historical resources studied there for the national park service and the the holders of the station license kph as i had discovered what alex anderson had really built there that nobody talked about and and this isn't i mean it's a mind-boggling electrical system that nobody had ever even talked about before or the theory or any of this type of stuff and so that is as part of the book i wrote is the mathematical and the archaeological study of all that and the diagram so i will be getting into detail explaining the difference between electro magnet magnetic transmission like rca used and we use now of the tesla transmission the alexandrian system and some of the even earlier systems that were electrostatic modes of transmission and and explained in such a way that you can understand these things you know what the electrical dimensions are you know why the speed of light is a part of everything that's going on and this actually something was just added on and give a kind of popular level theoretical basis for all this stuff and then there's diagrams of things you know they can actually be assembled that work wow well i speaking of the tesla technology aspect of transmission i'm a bit curious as to what your opinion is above the actual tower rebuild effort i understand currently that there are some hurdles that unfortunately don't allow for the tower constructed where it was originally intended but one of other potential locations around the world that could potentially rebuild that that effort is there any is there in your personal opinion and expertise have a reserve yeah is there any possibility that that could happen well i don't know i needed something that really belongs to belongs on a navy base somewhere but at any rate we have located an abandoned will not an abandoned but an old navy antenna field that's now somebody's private property and the idea is is to build the the small-scale model of this type of transmission system on the 160 meter hand bam we have the small world war two transmitters that we've been using for the the cosmic induction generator work that will work on that so we have the poles we have enough necessary ground wire we have to make negotiations with the property owner we don't know how that's going to work out yet but it might and so there there are plans to put together a very small scale model of what would have been a wardenclyffe on the san andreas fault in near san francisco and attempt to put a radio beacon of the tesla variety on the air so that you know various people or agencies or whatever can experiment and see the feasibility of using this as a transmission medium so that those plans are underway but all of this stuff takes a lot of time and fooling around and you know and there's everything's in your way there's obviously wherever you go there's somebody that wants to screw it up and the closer you get to the coast it's like a potential grading that starts to rise exponentially until when you reach san francisco that grade is infinite and nothing is possible in san francisco why well okay well i guess i would like to add i understand that you're currently engaged in multiple crowdfunding efforts that have essentially helped you grow in such what is your personal opinion of four inventors or any advice that you would give to inventors that pursue you know crowd funding sources versus actually going to the government for supporting things managed well don't go to the government support unless you have friends in the government well i guess that would yeah you're not gonna get anywhere so so the thing is you're gonna have to i mean i don't know like i say for me it's a remote thing because the the public funding thing involves all this internet activity you know there's there's people that work on that to put massive quantities of effort into it but it's a foreign thing to me i don't in my world i don't see that or know about it so it's really hard for me to talk about something that that existed another dimension if you understand what i'm saying that's also i don't i can't don't really know how to advise people you know first of all you're going to have to come up with something of significance that's worth dealing with they begin with and i don't really see where you know a lot of people didn't even have much of anything going on and so that's kind of a first complication and you know the same dead horse of soviet sailors conspiracy you know that people been whipping on to the point where there's not even a skeleton left and they're still talking about the same thing well that's a whole level of hopelessness so i i wish there was somebody well actually there are a few people through this the energetic form thing of my writings that are you know presently building this stuff and they've got successful results you know the light bulb lights up and doesn't light up in the engineering world you don't get paid in the end so they got it that far and so that's encouraging more and more people seem to be learning how to build and do this stuff and make it work they don't particularly need a lot of money you know they're just fooling around with small coils and stuff and models i mean it would be nice if somehow you know they had some level to support that the problem is you know it's pretty much most people because they have these lifestyles that consume money you know they have to go out and work for their lifestyles to the point where there's no money left over and there's no time left over so i don't know how they can get out of that so i really don't know what kind of advice to give people you know when there's all these different situations against it yeah that is unfortunate well we're very happy for your progress eric and i definitely would like to know of what would like to invite you out to the energy independence celebration that happens every july to celebrate nikola tesla's birthday i will talk to more about that i suppose after the show but i'm very curious about your own opinion of this idea of energy independence and how long off do you believe that to be a reality for everyone like what do we what hurdles do you feel are there and how long away do you think that we will have a fully independent sustainable energy distinction well are you talking about like the so-called free energy or energy synthesis or or more like solar panels and and windmills can you clarify that well i suppose more so along the lines of generalized breakthrough attention well the whole so-called free energy thing is i've kind of dropped that deal because it i don't i don't have an ac laboratory anymore i don't know where i could find the parts or how i could afford it so i pretty much had to drop all my my alternating current power work there is an in the same neighborhood that's that's putting together the what i call the long lines project with the telephone lines and all that there there is a move to acquire the old city substation building that the power company hasn't trashed the interior of yet to do an ac laboratory but it will take you know quite some time to negotiate with the power company and they come up with they're probably going to want you know like a half a million dollars or a million dollars for the building and all that and that pretty much should be one government agency paying you know another government agency which pays the power come behind it i don't know how i can get back into that kind of work i wrote a number of papers on energy synthesis people done experiments nobody has really come up with anything yet that turns the kilowatt hour and meter backwards of course they don't do that now they're all smart so you can't figure out what they're doing and but at any rate you know when when the meter goes backwards then somebody's got something going and and i don't know you know i just that's kind of a lost deal for me and the device i have in my car that does this uses this special vibrator which after 10 years is all worn out so now i don't have that anymore and i don't know where to find the part and all these things are looming up on me fast you know things you know 20 or 30 years have passed and and all my stuff's worn out you know it's i can't find the parts to fix things or replace it anymore so i kind of dropped out of all that i understand well i guess for listeners uh for those of you unfamiliar with the work of tesla if you could possibly eric briefly explain to them the difference between the way hertzian waves travel versus tesla waves okay well the secret the tesla's transmission system is it's mono polar so the electricity that's currently in use uses a number of poles in most people's education system you learn about plus and minus you know and there's always positive terminal and negative terminal or active lead and ground of course once you get in the three phase and four phase that all goes away but it's still multi terminal but tesla came up with an electrical system has only one phase so if you want to transmit it in the ground then the ground see active terminal well then the immediate question is to the technician what are you going to ground to you have to be the moon or mars and that doesn't make any sense because the wire wouldn't hold up so when tesla figured out was a way to ground into another dimension they use the words of physics or the proper term for discounters space so that he could push against something without having to have a wall or something back against that that is the secret to tesla's telluric transmission system and the transformers he developed could create this mono polar situation and oddly enough tesla did not even understand that because he was mostly working by experiments and the understanding of electricity was so primitive and impaired back then that that he arrived at this through a succession of experiments but he was nobody was capable of defining it analytically that that had to come later when they started building these large substation transformers which had so many windings on them and had such low losses that they would go in the tesla modes and blow up the substations so that's where steinmetz came in to lay the ground work mathematics and then general electric continued through another one of their engineering researchers a guy named eldon billy and he came up with that equation and then lo and behold alexanderson used that form for his transmission system so that laid the groundwork for for a theoretical basis for this and then through my experiments and my mathematical work is is with the ac paper that i'm writing i do take it to the mono polar consideration and i demonstrate the devices are working and in the upcoming lecture i'm going to get really deep into doubt okay well what are you definitely looking forward to that i would like to know though there's any individuals that you would like to thank for and such well i can thank aaron for you know helping me put all this together that's the first start and then you know i can thank the people that i don't know the name sub that came up with the money so that that we can provide the bond and then you know i'm thanking a number of the people in the government that i can't give the names out you know that they're willing to take the time you know to make my project part of you know their daily work and then you know i thank the people that you know that write me letters and want to know about stuff and then i write them back and they build things and then they send things back and then i you know that we do more figuring and then so so there's a lot of people to think that that i either can't mention the names of or i don't know or you know then that i do know wonderful well thank you erica but we are so great for your work and all of your study that's going into such great lysosome also sharing the legacy of nikola tesla well erik your work has been absolutely phenomenal and we really appreciate all the wonderful work you're doing for mankind and we want to thank you for joining us today on tesla vision and everyone we encourage you to check out erik p.com and erik this definitely won't be the last time we'll be hearing from you know i enjoy doing these things so i'm looking forward to the next opportunity oh absolutely we're definitely gonna have you on banker best of luck and thank you very much for joining tesla talk tv and we're looking forward to hear from you again okay well thank you thank you thank you bye now you\n"
